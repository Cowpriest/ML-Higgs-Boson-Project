# Higgs Boson Event Classification

Project Overview

This repository will contain an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for the Kaggle Higgs Boson challenge. Our goal is to distinguish between signal (Higgs boson decay) and background events using particle physics features extracted from simulated collision data.
